***** Explanation *****
Reverse the Integer by casting as a string. We also need to account for negative values so I cast an absolute value of the Integer as a string
Only 32 bit Integers are allowed so add a validation check
Determine if the Integer was negative to begin with. If so, make it negative when returned

***** Solution *****
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        stringo = str(abs(x))[::-1]

        if int(stringo) > 2**31:
            stringo = '0'
        elif x<0:
            stringo = '-' + stringo
        return int(stringo)
