#Divide and Conquer Algorithms
- The bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort, have worst-case running times of O(n^2). 
- When the size of the input array is large, these algorithms can take a long time to run.
- quicksort and merge sort, whose running times are better
- Both merge sort and quicksort employ a common algorithmic paradigm based on recursion. 
- This paradigm, divide-and-conquer, breaks a problem into subproblems that are similar to the original problem, recursively solves the subproblems, and finally combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.

Divide: the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
Conquer: the subproblems by solving them recursively. If they are small enough, solve the subproblems as base cases.
Combine: the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
