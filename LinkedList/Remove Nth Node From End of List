***** Notes *****
Best => 
- Two pointers L and R : L is initialised at 0th index and R at 2th index (to eliminate second last element, according to question)
- Increment both L and R, while making a differenc of two locations on each increment
- Increment both until R becomes Null
- Remove the Lth node


***** Solution *****
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        left = dummy
        right = head

        while n > 0:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1

        while right:
            left = left.next
            right = right.next

        left.next = left.next.next
        return dummy.next
