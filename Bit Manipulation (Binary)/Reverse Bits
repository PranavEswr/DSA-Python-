***** Notes *****
Best =>
- For bit-by-bit operation, take AND of input by shifting towards right
- "res" is initialised to zero, AND is not possible 
- OR each bit with "res" towards right 

***** Solution *****
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0

        for i in range(32):
            bit = (n>>i)&1
            res += bit << (31-i)
        return res
